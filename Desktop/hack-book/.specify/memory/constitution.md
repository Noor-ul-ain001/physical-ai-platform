- **High Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and interactive elements
- **Clean Aesthetic**: Minimalist design with ample white space
- **Consistent Hierarchy**: Clear visual structure using the color palette

## 🎯 **Founding Principles & Core Mission**

### **1. Gemini-Native Interactive Education**
We believe learning materials must be intelligent, adaptive, and conversational. Our textbook will be a living ecosystem powered by Google's Gemini that understands student needs through multi-modal interactions including voice, text, and contextual awareness.

### **2. Universal Accessibility**
Education must transcend language, technical, and physical barriers. Our platform will provide equal access through bilingual support (English/Urdu), voice interfaces, and adaptive content delivery using Gemini's multilingual capabilities.

### **3. Practical Mastery Through Simulation**
Theory without practice is incomplete. We bridge digital intelligence with physical embodiment through integrated simulations, hands-on projects, and real-world deployment scenarios enhanced by Gemini's reasoning capabilities.

### **4. Open Knowledge Ecosystem**
Education should be freely accessible, collaborative, and community-driven. We commit to open standards, transparent development, and inclusive participation using Gemini's generous free tier.
