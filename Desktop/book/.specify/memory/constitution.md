# Book & RAG Chatbot Hackathon Project Constitution

An integrated project for a hackathon with two main components: a book published via Docusaurus on GitHub Pages, and a RAG chatbot embedded within it.

## Core Principles

### I. AI & Spec-Driven
All development MUST follow the spec-driven methodology using the phases of constitution, specification, planning, tasks, and implementation. This ensures clarity, alignment, and verifiable progress.

### II. Code Quality
All generated code MUST be clean, well-documented, and modular. This facilitates maintainability, debugging, and future extensions.

### III. User Experience
The final book site and chatbot MUST be intuitive and easy to use. The primary goal is to provide a seamless and helpful experience for the end-user.

### IV. Integration
The chatbot MUST be seamlessly embedded into the Docusaurus book. It MUST be able to answer questions from the entire book's content or a user-selected text portion.

### V. Reusable Intelligence
The project SHOULD encourage the creation of Claude Code subagents and agent skills where possible to earn extra marks and build a more robust system.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for project principles. All development artifacts, including specifications, plans, and code, MUST align with it. Amendments require team consensus and an update to the version number according to Semantic Versioning.
