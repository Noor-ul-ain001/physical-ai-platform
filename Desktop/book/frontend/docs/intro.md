# Introduction: The Book of AI-Driven Development

Welcome to the Book of AI-Driven Development. This book is not just a guide to read, but an interactive application to experience.

Our goal is to explore a modern software development paradigm where AI agents, guided by clear specifications, become active participants in the creation process.

Navigate through the chapters to learn about our methodology, from foundational principles to advanced implementation patterns. Use the embedded chatbot to ask questions and interact with the content in a new way.
