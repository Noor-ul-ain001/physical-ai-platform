# Chapter 1: The Dawn of AI-Driven Development

Spec-driven development is a powerful methodology that emphasizes clarity and precision before implementation. By defining user stories, requirements, and success criteria upfront, teams can avoid ambiguity and build the right product from the start.

This book explores how to combine this rigorous approach with the power of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents. We call this AI-Driven Development. It's a process where the AI acts as a partner, translating the human-defined specification into code, tests, and documentation.

## Core Principles

The core principle is simple: the specification is the source of truth. The AI's job is to realize that truth in code. This requires a new way of thinking about both writing specs and interacting with AI.
