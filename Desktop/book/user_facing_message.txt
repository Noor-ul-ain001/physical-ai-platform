It seems there might have been an issue with the Docusaurus `swizzle` command's execution. I'm unable to find the expected `DocItem` component files, which are crucial for proceeding.

**Please re-run the `swizzle` command with extreme care, ensuring it completes successfully and creates the necessary files.**

Here are the detailed steps again:

1.  **Open your terminal or PowerShell.**
2.  **Navigate to your `frontend` directory:**
    `cd C:\Users\user\Desktop\book\frontend`
3.  **Execute the following command:**
    ```bash
    npm run docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic DocItem
    ```
4.  **When prompted, choose the following options:**
    *   `Which language do you want to use?`: Type `TypeScript` and press Enter.
    *   `Which swizzle action do you want to do?`: Choose `Wrap` (use arrow keys to navigate and press Enter).
    *   `Do you really want to swizzle this unsafe internal component?`: Type `Yes` and press Enter.

5.  **Crucial Verification Step:**
    *   After the command finishes, please **confirm that a directory named `DocItem` has been created under `frontend/src/theme/`**, and that it contains files like `index.tsx` (e.g., `C:\Users\user\Desktop\book\frontend\src\theme\DocItem\index.tsx`).
    *   **Please inform me specifically that you have verified the existence of this file.**

I cannot proceed with implementing the "Ask about this selection" feature until this file exists. Thank you for your patience!
