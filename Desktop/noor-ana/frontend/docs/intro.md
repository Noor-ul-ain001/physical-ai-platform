# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational platform. This 13-week curriculum is designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced applications in embodied intelligence.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, particularly robotics. Unlike traditional AI which operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI must contend with the complexities and uncertainties of the real world.

## Course Structure

This curriculum is divided into four modules:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Learn the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) framework, nodes, topics, services, and message passing.
2. **Simulation** - Master Gazebo and Unity ML-Agents for robot simulation and sensor testing.
3. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** - Explore NVIDIA's robotics simulation platform for synthetic data generation and robot learning.
4. **VLA Models** - Study Vision-Language-Action models for embodied AI and humanoid robot control.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand the core principles of embodied intelligence
- Be proficient in ROS 2 for robotic applications
- Know how to simulate and test robotic systems
- Understand NVIDIA's Isaac Sim platform and its applications
- Be familiar with Vision-Language-Action models for robotic control

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## Hardware Requirements

While you can complete most of the curriculum through simulation, we recommend access to:

- NVIDIA Jetson Orin (or equivalent development kit)
- Intel RealSense camera for depth perception
- Unitree Go1 or similar quadruped robot (optional for advanced modules)

Let's begin your journey into the fascinating world of Physical AI and humanoid robotics!
